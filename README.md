Yandex Practicum Project #3: From Portland to Portland

Link: https://master-sword.github.io/web_project_3/

This project tests students in most functionalities taught thus far
but conentrates mainly on different display sizes and use of media
queries in CSS.

The project was built in vanilla HTML and CSS. No use of JavaScript
(we're waiting keenly for it) for now.
